        A personal development plan is a guideline for your life and your future success. When you create a personal development plan, you start to define the kind of person you want to be, skills you want to have, and accomplishments you want to achieve. And then you map out your long-term and short-term goals to realize these aspirations and set timelines for when you want to reach them. When you practice self-discipline by setting a goal, making a plan, and working on it every day, you will see personal development and progress within your career. 
        <br>

          <li>Thoughtout and logical action plan</li>
          <li>Improve time management</li>
          <li>Progress tracking system </li>
          <li>Reduce stress and improve self-confidence</li>
